This is a POC for oAuth2.0. For now it covers the following grant flows:
- password (ongoing)

This is from a provider stand point and I follow the spec from version 31 which will expire February 1, 2013.
It can be found here: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-31

I will for now only implement what is needed and be pragmatic in writing down my code.
Therefore i'm useing whatever libraries available. So hereby I can onestly say I don't care about:
- creating dependecies and beeing library agnostic
- maintainable code
- tests

I wan't to get this working before someone else has eaten my lunch!
